## AI Usage Report

This project was developed in collaboration with an AI assistant (Google's Gemini). The AI played a significant role in the following areas:

-   **Initial Scaffolding:** Generated the initial Next.js project setup, directory structure, and `shadcn/ui` configuration commands.
-   **Component Generation:** Provided boilerplate code for all major components, including the Sidebar, Header, Cards, Charts, and Data Tables, which were then refined and customized.
-   **Bug Fixing & Debugging:** Assisted in identifying and resolving errors, such as incorrect import paths, TypeScript type mismatches, and React key errors.
-   **Advanced Feature Implementation:** Guided the implementation of complex features, including the custom hook for the advanced table, the export-to-PDF/CSV functionality, and the theme provider for dark/light mode.
-   **Code Refactoring:** Helped refactor complex components (like the `useAdvancedTable` hook) to improve readability and maintainability.
